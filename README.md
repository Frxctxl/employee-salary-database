# Employee Database Functionality
## Description
This project was undertaken as part of a coding bootcamp. A website was given with completed HTML and CSS code. The page's HTML had a title, a table, and a button. There was also a given script for the webpage that provided backend functionality that takes an array and funnels it into the webpage's table. I was tasked with creating three functions; one that created an array of employee objects based on user data when prompted; one that calculated and displayed the average annual salary; and one to randomly select an employee and display the result. The first two functions use for loops to iterate over the array, and the final function uses the javascript Math library to select a random index of the employee array.
